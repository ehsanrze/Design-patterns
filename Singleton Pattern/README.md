**Problem Definition**

You are developing a financial application that handles money transfers between user accounts. Multiple users may
initiate transactions simultaneously, potentially leading to concurrent access to shared resources such as account
balances. Ensuring the integrity and consistency of these transactions is critical.

**Problem:**

How do you ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, leading to race conditions, data corruption, or inconsistent states in the database?

**Requirements:**
- Thread Safety: Ensure that multiple threads executing transactions simultaneously do not cause race conditions.
- Transaction Management: Ensure that each transaction is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties). Any failure in a transaction should not affect the integrity of the database.
- Efficient Performance: Ensure that the solution does not significantly degrade the performance of the system, even with a high volume of concurrent transactions.


**Hints:**

Consider how you might use synchronization mechanisms to manage concurrent access to shared resources.
Think about how database transactions can be used to ensure ACID properties.
Explore design patterns that could help manage the instance handling the transaction logic to avoid multiple uncontrolled instances.
